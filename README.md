# ai-nn-image-classification

This is a neural network for image classification using pytorch including:

- Neural network layers like feed-forward and softmax
- Cost function using cross entropy
- stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
- parameters tuning (learning rate, batch size, momentum)
- activation functions
- overfitting prevention
